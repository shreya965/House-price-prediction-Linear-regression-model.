# House-price-prediction-Linear-regression-model.
House price prediction  using Simple Linear regression and  Multiple Linear Regression model.



## Project Overview

The project aims to build a regression model to predict house prices based on features such as:

- Area (in square feet)
- Number of bathrooms
- Number of bedrooms
- Furnishing status (furnished, semi-furnished, unfurnished)
- Other relevant features 

Key steps include:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and transformation (log transformation for skewed variables)
- Building simple and multiple linear regression models
- Evaluating model performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ²
- Visualizing results and checking model assumptions (residual plots, correlation heatmaps, etc.)
